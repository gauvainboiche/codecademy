# Welcome to my CodeCademy repo

You can find my exercices and small pieces of code in here while on the "Full-Stack engineer" PRO path of CodeCademy.

You can take anything you want. If it belongs to CodeCademy, then take it up with them. If it doesn't belong to them, it doesn't belong to anyway. I may use AI generated pictures in my projects, feel free to grab them. As well as the code, would you find it interesting.

## Overall

My projects may or may not used AI-generated code. It is either not a choice on my side (like when I forget to deactivate Copitol in VSCode, but that's rare, and the code always reflect my work process anyway), or some help I specifically made with the help of QwenCoder3.5-8b launched locally on my computer on LMStudio.

I would say that AI code make up around 5% of my overall work, mostly when I'm stuck.
