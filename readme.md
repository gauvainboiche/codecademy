# Welcome to my CodeCademy repo

You can find my exercices and small pieces of code in here while on the "Full-Stack engineer" PRO path of CodeCademy.

You can take anything you want. If it belongs to CodeCademy, then take it up with them. If it doesn't belong to them, it doesn't belong to anyway. I may use AI generated pictures in my projects, feel free to grab them. As well as the code, would you find it interesting.
