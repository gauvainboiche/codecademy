# FSCJ Building Interactive Websites

In the code editor, we have provided you with the starting code for a Book Finder website. Once the application is complete, you will be able to input a genre, title, or author into the search bar, and get back a list of books that match that criteria. You can see the list of books that your application will search in ```bookList.js```.

Your task is to finish building the application by completing the function definitions for the ```captureSearchValue()```, ```filterBooks()```, ```structureBooksAsHtml()```, and ```searchBtnClickHandler()``` functions. You should only make edits to these four function definitions within ```script.js```. Weâ€™ve defined helper functions in ```helper.js``` that you will need to use as you build out your program.
